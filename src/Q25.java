//25. A cow gives 15 liters of milk and eats 6 kg of fodder in a day.
// A farm produces 200 kg of fodder in a year.
// Write a Program to print the number of farms required, to feed the cows,
// required to produce milk for 10 Lakh people in a year, if each person drinks half liter of milk in a day.
// (Hint: Establish a link. Milk comes from cows, cows eat fodder and fodder comes from farms.
// So, first find total milk required, then number of cows required to give that amount of milk,
// from this you can get total fodder required every day and by multiplying by 365
// you get the amount required in a year.
// And that will enable you to get farms required.)
